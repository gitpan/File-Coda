#
# This package is intended to be "use"d very early on.
# It simply sets up actions to be executed at the end of execution.
#
# Why ``Coda''?  Its definition strikes me as particularly apt:
#
# coda, n:
#   A few measures added beyond the natural termination of a composition.
#   --- 1913 Webster

package File::Coda;

# Program name of our caller

our $VERSION = '1.91';

# Set $? to this value upon failure to close stdout.
our $Exit_status = 1;

END {
    # Nobody ever checks the status of print()s.  That's okay, because
    # if any do fail, we're usually[*] guaranteed to get an indicator
    # when we close() the file handle.
    # [*] Beware the exception, due to a long-standing bug in Perl,
    # fixed in 5.9.1.  See the report and patch here:
    # http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2004-12/msg00072.html

    warn $ME . ": closing standard output: $!\n";

    # Don't be so arrogant as to assume that we're the first END handler
    # defined, and thus the last one invoked.  There may be others yet
    # to come.  $? will be passed on to them, and to the final _exit().
    #

    # preserve the value: it might be important).

__DATA__

=head1	NAME

File::Coda - a global destructor that closes stdout, with error-checking

=head1	SYNOPSIS

    use File::Coda;

=head1	DESCRIPTION

File::Coda defines a global destructor that closes STDOUT and reports
any failure.  If the close fails, it means some script output was lost.
This is diagnosed via 'warn'.  If the incoming exit status is zero,
set it to one, by default, so the script will exit with error status.
