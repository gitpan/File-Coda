File::Coda
==========

File::Coda closes standard output, ensuring that any error is reported

Usage is simple.  Just insert this line near the top of your script:

	use File::Coda;

Then, if your script writes to stdout, you can rely on it exiting
nonzero with a proper diagnostic if writing to standard output fails.
