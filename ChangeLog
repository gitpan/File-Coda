	Version 1.92
	* Coda.pm (Version): Increment

	avoid spurious test failure due to LC_MESSAGES != C
	* t/01-basic.t: Set LC_ALL=C not just in the sample sub-script
	that we run, but also in each main test script.
	* t/02-noclobber.t: Likewise.

2009-12-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Version 1.91
	* Coda.pm (VERSION): Increment.

	Version 1.10
	* Coda.pm (VERSION): Increment.

	tests: accommodate a system with unwritable /dev/full
	* t/01-basic.t: Test for writability, not just existence of /dev/full.

2009-12-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: work around difference in Solaris' spelling of strerror(EBADF)
	* t/01-basic.t: Don't hard-code spelling of Linux's strerror(EBADF).
	* t/02-noclobber.t: Likewise.

2009-12-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: sign the tarball
	* Build.PL: Add sign => 1 option.
	Remove useless quotes on RHS '0's.

2009-12-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Version 1.9
	* Coda.pm ($VERSION): Increase to 1.9.

2009-11-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	make t/01 work even without /dev/full
	* t/01-basic.t: Without /dev/full, just skip that sub-test.

	make t/02 work even without /dev/full
	* t/02-noclobber.t: Eliminate FIXME: provoke failure
	with closed stdout rather than relying on /dev/full.

2009-11-29  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: say that we use "warn" for the diagnostic
	* Coda.pm: Say that we use "warn", rather than mentioning STDERR.
	Mention that "1" is just the default exit status.

2009-11-28  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Coda.pm: fix a subtle taint-related bug
	* Coda.pm: Don't use $ME (aka $0) *inside* double quotes.
	Its taintedness in that context would cause $! to expand to a
	number rather than to a string, thus making tests 01 and 02 fail.
	* t/01-basic.t: Reenable taint-checking, now that the
	problem is resolved.
	* t/02-noclobber.t: Likewise.

2009-11-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Version 1.8.
	* Coda.pm (VERSION): Increment.

	use Module::Build
	* Build.PL: New file.
	* Makefile.PL: Remove.
	* t/98-pod-coverage.t: New file.
	* t/99-pod.t: Likewise.

	maint: add LICENSE
	* LICENSE: New file.
	* MANIFEST: Add it.

2009-11-26  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: include all tests in tarball
	* MANIFEST: Add t/02*, t/03* and t/99*.

2007-02-11  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 1.4.
	* Coda.pm ($VERSION): Increase to 1.4.

	* Makefile.PL (WriteMakefile): Use gzip's --rsyncable option,
	if possible.

	* t/0*.t: Use "$ENV{LC_ALL} = 'C';".  That is simpler,
	should work just as well, and may even be more portable.

	Use setlocale to ensure we get English diagnostics.
	* t/01basic.t, t/02noclobber.t, t/03nointerfere.t: Use setlocale,
	in case the system default language is not "C" or en_*.
	This is necessary for some MacOS X configurations.
	Also fix typo: s/email line/stderr line/.
	Suggestions from Ed Santiago.

2007-01-19  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Version 1.3.
